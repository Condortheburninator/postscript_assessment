1. no issues with loading the platform b list
was able to use the following syntax to upload it
`CREATE TABLE SMS_PLATFORM_B_SUBSCRIBER_LIST AS SELECT * FROM 'data/SMS Platform B Subscriber List.csv';`
1. however, lots of issues with platform a list
    1. after some investigation two things are going on:
        1. `NULL` values are inputted as as a dash
        1. 1 row is causing problems
