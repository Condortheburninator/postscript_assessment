## :mag_right: Data Quality (Loading Data) & Data Cleanup

### Data Quality
1. no issues with loading the platform b list
    1. was able to use the following simple code to upload it `CREATE TABLE SMS_PLATFORM_B_SUBSCRIBER_LIST AS SELECT * FROM 'data/SMS Platform B Subscriber List.csv';`
1. however, lots of issues with platform a list
    1. after some investigation two things are going on:
        1. `NULL` values are inputted as as a dash  --> kept this as a `VARCHAR` and will solve for it later in a `VIEW`
        1. 1 row is causing problems :point_down: --> removed this row

         |       |          |                             |              |                  |            |   |
         | ----- | -------- | --------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ---------- | - |
         | SANTA | Checkout | Collected on SMS Platform B | Unsubscribed | 2023-07-06 11:53 | Subscribed | - |
1. duckdb had issues inferring some of the data types (mostly timestamps & timestamps with timezones)
    1. wanted to clean all of this up and `CREATE VIEWS` so I wouldn't have to deal with this later on
    1. ex. varchar to timestamptz
        1.  `2019-04-08 13:00:00 PDT` --> `2019-04-08 13:00:00-04`
